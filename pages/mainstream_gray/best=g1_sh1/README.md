Code in current_best_convert_one.py.

Created using gray->sharpen.

Folder naming system:

pages/mainstream = color

pages/mainstream_gray = grayscale

g# = number of times grayscaled/color shifted

d# = number of times detailed

e# = number of times edge enhanced

sm# = number of times smoothed

sh# = number of times sharpened

ie.

```
pages/mainstream_gray/sh1_g1_sm2
```

= sharpened the color image, then grayscaled, then smoothed twice.


Currently looking promising: g1_sh1
